# ionic-image-upload-example
This project was build just to test and learn how to properly use ngCordova Camera and ngCordova File transfer to:
- Take Picture from real device camera (Android / iOS)
- Show a preview of the image to the user
- Store the image on a safe location
- Store this safe location on a local storage variable
- Send the images to a server using ngCordova fileTransfer

It's currently under development and I will keep updating the code as I'm learing.
The ideal project would be an app that takes any number of pictures in an Offline mode and then uploads all the images when the user gets online.
